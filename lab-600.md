CIP-600 Tutorial – Test API using a REST client

##Objective

Test the API created in the CIP-100 Tutorial using is the Postman REST client.

Completion Time: 15 minutes

##Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through how to test an API developed in API designer by enabling the mock service in API console.

##Assumptions

You know the basics of how to create an API in API designer.

##Prerequisites

Access to API manager and API Designer

**_URL:_** [https://webapi.cisco.com/accounts/#/signin](https://webapi.cisco.com/accounts/#/signin)

Postman REST client

Completed the CIP Tutorial-100.

**_Note:_** if you are not at CISCO Live San Diego, create an account your own account of mule soft API manager using the below URL.

And download the Postman REST client using the below URL and install it in your machine .

##Steps

**_Login to API manager_**

To start with the RAML Tutorial 600 we need to access the API manager.

Use the URL below for accessing the API manager. Provide your credentials as given below.

[https://webapi.cisco.com/accounts/#/signin](https://webapi.cisco.com/accounts/#/signin)

Click the APIs tab on upper right hand corner

##  

The above step takes you to the API creation\search page. Here on the search text, type the API name you created on CIP-100 tutorial. Once you type and press enter you can see your API as in the example below.

##  

## _ _

## _ _

##  

##  

Click on the API name e.g. HelloRAML API.

By clicking the API name a detailed page is displayed as shown below.

Now click on the _Define API in API designer_ link as shown in the screen below.

##  

## _ _

Once you click the link on the step above you will be able to see the black screen of the API designer. On the right of your designer is the API console as highlighted in screen below.

**_API console view_**

** **

** **

Click on the resources and see the details populated from RAML to the API console.

**_Enabling mock service_**

On the top right hand side of your API console you see a toggle button to enable the mock service.

A mock service is a feature provided by the API console which helps in testing your API using the example stubbed in your RAML (in API designer). When you enable the mock service and test the API in the API console, you can see the response based on the example you provide in your RAML.

Lets try it out by enabling the mock service. Now to enable the mock service lets toggle the button to the right as shown in the below screen.

Once you enable the mock service, you can observe that the base URI of your API provided in the RAML has been changed as shown in the below screen. This new URI is the mock service end point URI.

You can also see that the earlier base URI (original) you provided has been disabled or commented.

** **

** **

**_Try it feature_**

Now we have enabled the mock service. Let’s try testing the resource from API console.

Under the **_employees_** parent resource you can see the details of child resource

Now click on the get tab on the right of **_/employees/details_** resource as shown in the screen

below.

** **

Once you click on the get button you could see a panel showing the try it button and a section below which shows the response and request parameters that the API requires . This section is populated from the RAML file which you have defined using the editor as shown in the screen below.

Now let’s click on the try it button as shown in screen below and see the response for the API you have developed.

Once you click the **Try it** button, you can see a new panel to provide the parameters with a GET button.

Since the/employees/detail is a **_get_** method we don’t have any specific parameters to be passed.

Now click on the **Get** button as shown in the below screen.

When you click the **GET** button, you can see that response below which is the example you provided in the RAML example section.

This exercise shows that API console carries the necessary documentation related to your API and the mock service is a non-intelligent test response provider.

**_Using the Postman REST client_**

Now let’s try invoking the same API from Postman REST API client. For this first let’s open the Postman client installed on your machine.

Now copy the mock service URL from the **Try it** panel which you executed in the above step. Please see the screen below for reference.

Paste the URL in the postman client as shown below and press the send button.

Now you can see the response you get in the API console is available in the Postman REST client (screen below). This response is the example provided in the RAML file.

Congratulations, now you have successfully executed your API using the mock service URL.
